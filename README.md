# Transformation-Visualization
Kofax Transformation project that helps visualize elements of document data.

Test locators to visually show the various elements in the representation:
* Graphic Lines (such as populated by table locator)
* Boxes (such as populated by Mixed Print OCR)
* Blocks (such as populated by table locator)
* Keywords (such as can be used in Format Locators)

These can be run directly on an existing xdc to view what has already been created.  If testing on a fresh document, run Mixed Print OCR,  table locator, and Format Locator to create many of these elements.
